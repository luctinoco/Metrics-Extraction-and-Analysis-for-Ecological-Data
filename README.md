# Metrics-Extraction-and-Analysis-for-Ecological-Data
This project involves metrics extraction and analysis of ecological data collected from small mammal species within the Atlantic Forest. The analysis uses landscape metrics, bioclimatic variables, and diversity indices to study the impact of environmental factors on Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates in Didelphis aurita.

# Project Title: Metrics Extraction and Analysis for Ecological Data

## Overview

This project involves metrics extraction and analysis of ecological data collected from small mammal species within the Atlantic Forest. The analysis uses landscape metrics, bioclimatic variables, and diversity indices to study the impact of environmental factors on Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates in Didelphis aurita.

## Features

- Analysis of landscape fragmentation and its relationship to ecological data.
- Use of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality.
- Evaluation of bioclimatic variables and their influence on infection rates.
- Calculation of diversity indices (e.g., **Alpha Fisher**, **Menhinick**).
- Use of **R** for data processing and statistical modeling.

## Files

- **Recorte-Metricas(2024).R**: Main R script for processing data and running analysis.
- **data/**: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
- **results/**: Contains the output from the analysis (graphs, tables, etc.).
